## Problem Statement

When a LoreTask Job runs, the only way to see what Claude Code is
doing is `kubectl logs`. Developers and platform engineers have no
visibility into running tasks from the Lore UI. They see "running"
and wait — no progress, no output, no indication if the agent is
stuck or making progress.

## Solution

Stream Job pod logs into the pipeline UI in real-time.

### Architecture

```
Job Pod → stdout/stderr
  ↓
Controller reads pod logs (on poll + on completion)
  ↓
Writes to LoreTask status.output (last 5000 chars, already exists)
  ↓
New: also writes to pipeline.task_events as log entries
  ↓
UI task detail page polls /api/pipeline/[id]/logs every 5s
  ↓
Renders log output in a scrollable terminal-style div
```

### What Changes

**1. Controller log streaming** (`agent/src/loretask-controller.ts`)

During `checkJob()`, when the LoreTask is in `Running` phase:
- Read pod logs (tail 100 lines)
- Patch LoreTask `status.output` with latest logs
- This happens every 15s via the poll loop (already exists)

**2. Watcher stores logs in DB** (`agent/src/jobs/loretask-watcher.ts`)

When watcher processes a Running LoreTask:
- Read `status.output` from the CR
- Store in a new `pipeline.task_logs` table or in `task_events` metadata
- The watcher already polls every minute

**3. API route** (`web-ui/src/app/api/pipeline/[id]/logs/route.ts`)

New server-side route:
- Reads task from DB
- If task has a LoreTask CR (implementation/review), read pod logs via K8s API
- Returns logs as plain text or JSON lines
- Supports `?since=<timestamp>` for incremental fetching

**4. UI component** (`web-ui/src/app/pipeline/[id]/TaskLogs.tsx`)

Client component:
- Polls `/api/pipeline/{id}/logs` every 5s while task is running
- Renders in a `<pre>` with monospace font, dark background
- Auto-scrolls to bottom
- Shows "Completed" or "Failed" header when task finishes
- Falls back to "No logs available" for non-CRD tasks

**5. Data storage option**

Option A: Store logs in `pipeline.task_events` with `to_status: 'log'`
Option B: New `pipeline.task_logs` table with `(task_id, timestamp, content)`
Option C: Read directly from K8s API (no DB storage, only works while pod exists)

Recommended: **Option C for live, Option A for historical**. While
the pod is running, read from K8s. After completion, the final output
is already stored in LoreTask `status.output` and transferred to
`task_events` by the watcher.

## Out of Scope

1. WebSocket streaming — polling is sufficient for Phase 0
2. Log search/filtering — just raw output
3. Log retention beyond task lifetime — cleaned up with LoreTask CR

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Running task shows live logs in pipeline detail page
2. Logs update every 5s while task is running
3. Completed/failed tasks show final output
4. No kubectl access needed to see what the agent is doing
